SpaceCaptain
============

Space Captain is a persistent browser based turned based role playing game.

It was written to support a dissertaton which foccussed on the suitability of PHP as games development language.

A large focus of the dissertation focussed of creating a product that was a cross platform and playable on as many systems as possible.
The game is completely responsive offering a optimised experience between screen sizes (especially mobile). 
Javascript was sparingly used to increase platform compatibility. Suitable fallbacks were employed where Javascript was neccesary.

Persistence was achieved through the use of a database and cron jobs.
